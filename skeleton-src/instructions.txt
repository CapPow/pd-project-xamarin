1. Be sure to give the app gps permissions and filesystem permissions in your emulator
2. If you have issues with dependencies, or building either project, send me an email. You could be missing a nuget package or version mismatch, etc.
3. The GPS 'plugin' I'm using doesn't have to be what the App ships with. It's just the first I had luck with.

This solution should work with an iOS emulator, given the proper permissions.
 - As of now I haven't test iOS* 5/26/2018 5:04 PM :P
 - I haven't added permission pop-ups to request them yet, so for now you have to give the App explicit permissions yourself.

this is initial GPS skeleton app for meeting 5/26
